Using sound waves to identify holes in watermelons must be the most interesting article I've read in the last 6 months.

Paper DOI:https://doi.org/10.5424/sjar/2005031-124

From the results, watermelons with frequencies lower than 168Hz have holes, while those above 226Hz do not. Generally, watermelons with holes are more likely to be ripe, so ripeness can be judged by frequency, where lower frequencies indicate greater ripeness. 

How can this be done practically?
1. Tap the watermelon with your hand and record the sound with a smartphone.
2. Analyze the recording using spectrum analysis (Fourier analysis), which can be done using software like Matlab.
3. If the main frequency is below 168Hz, it's a good melon; if it's above 226Hz, it's not ripe; if the frequency is between 168-226Hz, it's up to luck.
